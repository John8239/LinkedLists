# LinkedLists

<h3>This project:</h2>

1. pre-creates 26 linked lists of type person (a class that contains a string for a name and an int for an age) for each letter of the alphabet

2. All of these linked lists are stored in a map of the chars of the alphabet as the keys, with the respective linked list as its value 

3. Then the program reads names and ages from a file and creates a person object out of them.

4. Then the person object is added to the appropriate linked list, and inserted in the correct alphabetical order within that list.
    - For ex: 'Aaron', 'Albert', 'Amber', etc.
